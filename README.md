## Tech used: [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,webpack,npm,nodejs,mongodb,postman)](https://skillicons.dev)

This is a Traversy Media course project for a dynamic full-stack web application designed for sharing and managing random ideas. Through this project, I learned to implement modal functionality with vanilla JavaScript, configure Webpack for asset bundling, and develop back-end skills using MongoDB and Node.js. I also gained experience in hosting a full-stack application.
